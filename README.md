# Robotics RaspberryPi Project

This is a project that was completed during January 2018 as part of a group study project. The goal of this project was to create a robot that is capable of following a path made from colored tape. This was accomplished using a Rasberry pi attached to a set of programmable wheels and a Photodetector. The python code in this repository contains the logic neccesary to follow the tape. 

### Getting Started 

To run this program on a Raspberry Pi you must plug in the board to a computer with the code and transfer it using PuTTY.
