# Robotics-RasberryPi-Project
This is a project that was completed during January 2018 as part of a group study project. The goal of this project was to create a robot that is capable of following a path made from colored tape. This was accomplished using a Rasberry pi attached to a set of programmable wheels and a Photodetector. The python code in this repository contains the logic neccesary to follow the tape.
